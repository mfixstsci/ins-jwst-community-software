# Project Must Have Basic Accessibility Standards Implemented

This is one of the tier 2 standards. See full list [on the main page](../README.md).

## Short description

Software we develop must be easy to approach, use, and understand for as many people as possible. 

## Importance of this standard

A focus on accessibility removes barriers for persons with disabilities

## Options for this standard

Note that not all requirements may not be relevant to every project, and this list is my no means exhaustive.

## How to apply this standard

- Text alternatives
[Images should have descriptive (alt) text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content.html)
                
- Keyboard navigate
[You can get around using the keyboard alone](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard.html)

- Headings and Labels
[Headings are descriptive of the content that they contain, form labels clearly describe what information is required, and buttons inform the user what will happen when theyâ€™re pressed](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/headings-and-labels.html)
